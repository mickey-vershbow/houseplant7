# Native Plants App

The Native Plants app was originally designed as a "house plant" app, wherein users could browse a selection of house plants, learn about them, and save their favorites to a personal collection. However, after building the basic structure, it became apparent that it would be necessary to create a custom API, as there was no free public API for indoor plants in existence. At that point I decided to modify the concept of the app - changing it from indoor plants to general botanical plants data that users could browse and collect. The idea is to filter the data by various locations, so users can try to identify native plants wherever they live.
