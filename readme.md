# Native Plants App

The Native Plants app was originally designed as a "house plant" app, wherein users could browse a selection of house plants, learn about them, and save their favorites to a personal collection. However, after building the basic structure, it became apparent that it would be necessary to create a custom API, as there was no free public API for indoor plants in existence. At that point I decided to modify the concept of the app - changing it from indoor plants to general botanical plants data that users could browse and collect. The idea is to filter the data by various locations, so users can try to identify native plants wherever they live.

# Getting Started

- clone with command `npx degit githubusername/githubreponame#branchname projectName`

- cd into new project folder

- run `npm install` to install dependencies

- rename template.env to .env

- make sure to replace MONGODB_URL with a working Mongo URL

- enjoy!

# My Experience

## Challenges

- Pagination: the 3rd party API only returns 30 objects (out of millions) at a time, and I needed to load multiple pages. At first I approached it by trying to write a function that loaded a new page every time the user clicked "next", but figuring out how to display the new data with DOM manipulation and jQuery became a huge blocker. Eventually Alex showed me how to add a "page number" variable that got incremented and passed into the actual API call every time the user clicked "next", and that was way simpler.

- Styling: I made the mistake of building a multi-column site, and boy do I regret it. All it takes is changing the font size or adding an image to throw all the columns out of whack. I'm now very interested in building single column websites.


## Key Takeaways

- Making initial drafts of trello board, wireframes, and ERD's before I start programming is really essential. It's super easy to end up programming myself into a corner otherwise and having to refactor lots of code as I go. Wireframes also make it much easier to focus on one task at a time because I have a system to keep track of everything that needs to get done overall.

- Keeping projects within a realistic scope (in regard to timeline) is key to actually producing a functional project. A lot of features that I imagined would be simple were, in fact, not simple at all.

## The IceBox

- Refactor the app as "Native Plants"
- Go further with 3rd party API data. Create show pages for all the plants in the index; access more data properties and display them; give users the option to "save" plants from the index to their own collection; create the ability to filter data based on location and/or other conditions.
- Give users the abiilty to add more than one image per plant entry.
- Rethink the "store" concept, does that still work with Native Plants or should it be something else entirely?
